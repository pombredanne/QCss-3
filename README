QCss3
========

QCss3 is an application to gather information on load balancers
through SNMP, store them and serve them through a Web interface or a
REST API.

Installation
------------

To use this application, you need the following Debian packages:
 - python (2.4 or more)
 - postgresql-8.2 (PostgreSQL 8.2 - http://www.postgresql.org)
 - python-psycopg2 (Psycopg - http://initd.org/psycopg/)
 - python-twisted-core (Twisted - http://twistedmatrix.com)
 - python-twisted-names (Twisted Names - http://twistedmatrix.com)
 - python-nevow (Nevow - http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodNevow)
 - python-yaml (PyYAML - http://pyyaml.org/)

You then need to create a database and install the corresponding
schema. As postgres user ("su - postgres"), you can use the following:

  createuser -P qcss3
  createdb -O qcss3 qcss3

Then load the content of doc/database.sql:

  psql -h localhost -U qcss3 -W < doc/database.sql

You need to write a "qcss3.cfg" file. See doc/qcss3.cfg.sample for
an example. The default path for this file is
/etc/qcss3/qcss3.cfg. You can alter it with "--config" option.

You can install the application with:
 python setup.py build
 sudo python setup.py install

If you do not wish to install the application, you still need to
compile the module to build SNMP queries. This can be done with:
 python setup.py build_ext --inplace

You can launch the application by hand
 twistd -no qcss3
or
 twistd -no qcss3 --config=/etc/qcss3/qcss3.cfg
